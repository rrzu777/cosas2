				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I jumped into the big, crazy, amazing world of freelancing and building websites for clients I was so excited to get to do what I loved from the comfort of my home. But there was a flaw in my business and I didn&#8217;t know it — that was until one month I only made $708.75. That&#8217;s not even enough to cover rent.</p>
<p>The problem? I was only building static websites, and performing front-end development work.</p>
<p>There were two types of jobs I would get:</p>
<p>1) I&#8217;d code static websites, or HTML &amp; CSS templates and invoice for up to $2k per project.</p>
<p>2) I&#8217;d get a dynamic website request and I would code the HTML, CSS and JS then pay a back-end developer to finish the site up for me and hook it into a CMS, like WordPress. In the end, I&#8217;d pay the developer around $1k &#8211; $3k and net only $1k &#8211; $2k for myself.</p>
<p>There were times I even rejected an opportunity because it involved WordPress development!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with that scenario? Well, for one, talk about MISSED OPPORTUNITIES! Two, I&#8217;d pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket to have somebody finish my work for me. And most crucially, I let my FEAR of learning WordPress get in the way of me growing my business, getting hired by premium clientele, and making 2x &#8211; 3x more money every single month.</p>
<p>&#8230;silly Brad!</p>
<p><strong>In my first year of business, I&#8217;d calculated that I&#8217;d spent around $8,000 to pay for WordPress developers, and I&#8217;d missed around $16,000 in potential business as a WordPress developer.</strong></p>
<p>Let me break this down for you:</p>
<p>In a 12-month period, there were around 5 WordPress projects I paid a developer $1k &#8211; $3k to build. Grand total: $8,000!</p>
<p>In that same period, there were at least 8 requests to build a WordPress website I could have easily charged $2,000+ for. <strong>Total in missed business? $16,000.</strong></p>
<p>Shortly into my second year of business I decided enough was enough, and I had to stop letting my fear of WordPress from getting in the way of me growing my business, getting hired by premium clientele, and making more money.</p>
<p>Since then, building custom WordPress websites, and updating custom WordPress websites account for 99% of my freelance business. And all that money I shelled out to pay WordPress developers? It now goes straight into my pocket, so I can rest assured I can provide for family, as we are only a single income household. No more $708.75 months!</p>
